    "    Of all of the variables I chose, university admission rate was most significantly correlated with US News Rank. There was a correltaional coefficient of .65, which means that as US News Rank decreases, so does the admission rate. This matched my assumptions, because it means that the highest ranked schools are also the most selective. The next most correlated variable was SAT scores. A correlational coefficient of -0.48 means that as rank decreases, scores increase. Again, this is intuitive that the highest rank schools admit students with the highest scores. My other variables such as income, minority student demographics and tuition had little to no real correlation with US News ranking."

One website may return, \"UCSB\", another \"UC Santa Barbara\" and another \"University of California, Santa Barbara\". I did extensive data cleaning, manipulation, and used a package called fuzzywuzzy that asseses string similarity in order to help me properly map schools that may go by several different names. I have been able to play with my program and eyeball a couple of stats that seem a bit off. While I am very happy with the overall accuracy of my data mapping, there are a few instances where names map incorrectly."

For instance, when you run the code in the command line the graphs pop on top of each other. I could never find a robust solution to pop many figures around the screen without crashing my program. \n",

There are also many other variables that could be taken into consideration, such as graduation/retention rates, faculty resources and class size. Another way the analysis could be expanded is by using AIC model selection to determine which variables have the greatest affect on Rank."
